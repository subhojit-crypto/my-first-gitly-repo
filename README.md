# My First Gitly Project

This is my first project where I learned Git and GitHub through the Gitly Accelerated Onboarding Protocol!

## What's inside?
- `first_file.txt`: A file for learning Git basics.
- `new-feature.txt`: Content from my first feature branch.
- `.gitignore`: My "do not track" list.

## How to use
(You can add instructions here if your project actually did something)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-first-gitly-repo.git`
2. Explore the files!
